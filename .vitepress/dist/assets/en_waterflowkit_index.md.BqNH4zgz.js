Ensure all connections are watertight and the sensors are properly installed on your water pipes.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How do I connect the WaterFlowKit to my WiFi network?</strong></p><ul><li>Upon starting up the kit, the WaterFlowKit emits a WiFi hotspot named &#39;waterflowkit&#39; with the password &#39;waterflowkit&#39;. Connect to this hotspot and follow the on-screen instructions to select and connect to your own WiFi network.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How can I view and manage the entities in Home Assistant?</strong></p><ul><li>Open Home Assistant, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>ESPHome</strong>, and select the <strong>WaterFlowKit</strong> device. Here, you can view and manage all the entities associated with the WaterFlowKit. Disable any unused entities if you are not using both sensors or the temperature sensor.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What should I do if the WaterFlowKit is not reporting data correctly?</strong></p><ul><li>Refer to the <a href="./troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Guide</a> for steps to resolve common issues. Ensure all cables are securely connected and the sensors are properly positioned.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Is the WaterFlowKit waterproof?</strong></p><ul><li>The sensors are IP52 rated, providing protection against dust and light moisture. However, the main unit is IP20 rated and suitable for indoor use only. Any defects caused by water exposure are not covered under warranty. For more details, refer to the <a href="./warranty-and-support">Warranty and Support</a> page.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How do the sensors measure water flow?</strong></p><ul><li>The water flow sensors measure flow using a turbine mechanism inside the sensor. As water flows through the sensor, it spins the turbine, generating pulses that are counted to determine the flow rate. Each pulse corresponds to a specific volume of water.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How should I mount the WaterFlowKit sensors?</strong></p><ul><li>Install the waterflow sensors on your water pipes, ensuring all connections are securely tightened and properly waterproofed. Apply thread seal tape to the screw threads to guarantee a watertight seal. Refer to the <a href="./installation">Installation Guide</a> for detailed steps.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are the maximum and minimum flow and temperature ranges for the WaterFlowKit?</strong></p><ul><li>The flow and temperature ranges vary depending on the sensor model. Here are the ranges: <ul><li><strong>Flow Range</strong>: 1-50 L/min (depending on the sensor model)</li><li><strong>Temperature Range</strong>: 0 °C to +80 °C</li></ul></li><li>For detailed specifications, refer to the <a href="./technical-specifications">Technical Specifications</a> page.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the difference between the WaterFlowKit and the WaterMeterKit?</strong></p><ul><li>The WaterFlowKit is intended to be installed on an individual pipe within your home. This allows you to monitor specific points of water usage, such as individual faucets or lines, and you can install multiple WaterFlowKits throughout your home to monitor different locations. In contrast, the WaterMeterKit is designed to read the water meter provided by your water utility or a standalone water meter with a 1-liter metal plate indicator.</li></ul></li></ol><p>For further assistance, please join our <a href="https://smarthomeshop.io/discord" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord server</a> for personalized support and community interaction.</p>',8),s=[n];function l(d,u,h,p,c,w){return i(),o("div",null,s)}const y=t(r,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
