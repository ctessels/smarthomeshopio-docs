Connect to this hotspot and follow the on-screen instructions to select and connect to your own WiFi network.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What should I do if the UltimateSensor is not reporting data correctly?</strong></p><ul><li>Refer to the <a href="./troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Guide</a> for steps to resolve common issues. Ensure all cables are securely connected and the sensor is properly positioned.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Is the UltimateSensor waterproof?</strong></p><ul><li>The sensor is IP20 rated and suitable for indoor use only. Any defects caused by water exposure are not covered under warranty. For more details, refer to the <a href="./technical-specifications">Technical Specifications</a> page.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What types of measurements can the UltimateSensor perform?</strong></p><ul><li>The UltimateSensor measures CO2, temperature, humidity, light intensity (lux), VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and room occupancy using mmWave radar.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How do I integrate the UltimateSensor with Home Assistant?</strong></p><ul><li>The UltimateSensor can be easily integrated with Home Assistant via WiFi or an Ethernet connection. Note: The Ethernet connection will only function if the Ethernet firmware is installed on the device. This allows for efficient management and monitoring of your smart home environment.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Can I use the UltimateSensor outdoors?</strong></p><ul><li>The UltimateSensor is designed for indoor use and is not suitable for outdoor applications.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Can I expand the UltimateSensor with additional modules myself?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes, the UltimateSensor is designed to be modular. You can upgrade and easily replace the mmWave Motion Sensor, in your UltimateSensor for added functionality at any time.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the power supply for the UltimateSensor?</strong></p><ul><li>The UltimateSensor is primarily powered via a USB-C connection. It can also be powered via PoE (Power over Ethernet) but this option is only available when the Ethernet firmware is installed on the device. It comes with a European USB Power Adapter; however, if you are located outside Europe, while you will receive the adapter, you may also use any other compatible power adapter providing at least 1A.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How to use WiFi or Ethernet port (PoE)?</strong></p></li></ol><ul><li>The UltimateSensor offers flexible connectivity options through WiFi and Ethernet (Power over Ethernet or PoE). Both methods ensure reliable performance, with Ethernet PoE being particularly useful in environments where WiFi connectivity might be inconsistent. For more detailed instructions on switching between WiFi and Ethernet or setting up PoE, refer to the <a href="./firmware">firmware page</a>. Here’s how to use each: <ul><li>WiFi: To connect the UltimateSensor to your WiFi network, ensure your device is powered on and within range of your WiFi router. Follow the on-screen instructions to select and connect to your network. This setup is ideal for quick and wireless integration.</li><li>Ethernet (PoE): For a more stable and continuous power supply, you can connect the UltimateSensor via an Ethernet cable that supports PoE. This not only provides a stable internet connection but also powers the device, eliminating the need for a separate power adapter. Simply connect the Ethernet cable to the PoE-enabled port on the UltimateSensor and configure the network settings accordingly.</li></ul></li></ul>',8),s=[r];function l(h,u,c,d,p,m){return i(),o("div",null,s)}const y=t(a,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
