Do not over-tighten. Make sure the sensor is firmly pressed down into the holder, with the black side always visible and facing upwards.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="Install Sensor Holder"></p><p>Note: Sometimes the lid (the outer plastic part) of your meter can get in the way.

The WaterMeterKit should flash a green light for 1 second after each liter of water used to confirm measurement. If this does not happen, you may need to adjust the sensor&#39;s position slightly, sometimes by as little as 1mm.</p><p>Note: Ignore the red flashing status LED for now.
