# Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter any issues with the WaterFlowKit, try the following steps:

## General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Ensure All Cables Are Securely Connected**
   - Verify that the USB-C power cable is securely connected to both the WaterFlowKit and the power adapter.
   - Ensure the waterflow sensor cables are properly attached and clicked in the connectors.

2. **Check the Power Source**
   - Make sure the power adapter is plugged into a working electrical outlet.
   - Ensure the power cable is not damaged and is functioning properly.

3. **Restart the WaterFlowKit**
   - Unplug the power cable from the WaterFlowKit, wait for 10 seconds, and then plug it back in.

4. **Restart Home Assistant**
   - Sometimes a simple restart of Home Assistant can resolve connectivity or integration issues. Navigate to **Settings > System > Restart** within Home Assistant.

5. **Update Home Assistant**
   - Ensure you are running the latest version of Home Assistant. Go to **Settings > System > Updates** to check for and install any available updates.

## WiFi Connectivity Issues

1. **Check WiFi Signal Strength**
   - Ensure that the WaterFlowKit is within range of your WiFi router. Weak signal strength can cause connectivity issues.
   - If necessary, move the WaterFlowKit closer to the router or use a WiFi extender to improve signal strength.

2. **Reconnect to WiFi**
   - If the WaterFlowKit is not connecting to your WiFi network, try reconnecting:
     1. Power off the WaterFlowKit.
     2. Power it back on and connect to the WiFi hotspot named 'waterflowkit' with the password 'waterflowkit'.
     3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select and connect to your WiFi network.

3. **Check WiFi Network Configuration**
   - Ensure your WiFi network is set to 2.4 GHz, as the WaterFlowKit does not support 5 GHz networks.
