Note that the device comes with a European USB Power Adapter. If you live outside Europe, you will still receive the adapter in the box, but you can also use any other power adapter you have at home as long as it provides at least 1A.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="Power by Cable"></p><h2 id="step-2-connect-to-wifi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-2-connect-to-wifi"><span>Step 2: Connect to WiFi</span></a></h2><p>Upon starting up the kit, the UltimateSensor Mini emits a WiFi hotspot named &#39;ultimatesensor-mini&#39; with the password &#39;ultimatesensor-mini&#39;. Connect to this hotspot and a pop-up window will appear, allowing you to select and connect to your own WiFi network. Ensure that your WiFi network is a 2.4 GHz network. If the fallback hotspot does not appear, try using a different device. It may take up to one minute for the WiFi to become visible after powering on the device.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Connect to WiFi"></p><p>Note: When you connect to the fallback network, the web interface should open automatically. If that does not work, you can also navigate to <a href="http://192.168.4.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://192.168.4.1/</a> manually in your browser.</p><h2 id="step-3-connect-to-home-assistant" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-3-connect-to-home-assistant"><span>Step 3: Connect to Home Assistant</span></a></h2><p>Once connected to your home WiFi network, Home Assistant will automatically detect the UltimateSensor Mini under the &#39;Devices &amp; Services&#39; section. If this does not happen, you need to add the device manually. Look up the IP address of the UltimateSensor Mini in your router, then go to Home Assistant settings -&gt; Devices &amp; Services. Click on Add Integration, select ESPHome, and enter the IP address of the device. It will then be added.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="Connect to Home Assistant"></p><p>After connecting to Home Assistant, your device will be visible under Home Assistant -&gt; Settings -&gt; Devices &amp; Services -&gt; look for the ESPHome integration.
