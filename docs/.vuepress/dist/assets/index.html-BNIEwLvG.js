In contrast, the WaterFlowKit is intended to be installed on an individual pipe within your home. This allows you to monitor specific points of water usage, such as individual faucets or lines, and you can install multiple WaterFlowKits throughout your home to monitor different locations.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the difference between the WaterMeterKit and the WaterP1MeterKit?</strong></p><ul><li>The WaterMeterKit is designed to read the water meter provided by your water utility or a standalone water meter with a 1-liter metal plate indicator. The WaterP1MeterKit, on the other hand, can also be used to measure your water consumption but includes additional features. The WaterP1MeterKit connects to your energy meter via a P1 port to read energy usage data and has an Ethernet port with Power over Ethernet (PoE) support. This means you can use a wired connection instead of WiFi, providing a more stable and reliable network connection. The WaterMeterKit only has WiFi build-in.</li></ul></li>",3),v=e("p",null,[t("For further assistance, please join our "),e("a",{href:"https://smarthomeshop.io/discord",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Discord server"),t(" for personalized support and community interaction.")],-1);function y(k,W){const i=s("RouteLink");return u(),l("div",null,[c,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[r(i,{to:"/watermeterkit-v2/installation.html"},{default:o(()=>[t("Installation")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[r(i,{to:"/watermeterkit-v2/usage.html"},{default:o(()=>[t("Usage")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[r(i,{to:"/watermeterkit-v2/troubleshooting.html"},{default:o(()=>[t("Troubleshooting")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[r(i,{to:"/watermeterkit-v2/technical-specifications.html"},{default:o(()=>[t("Technical Specifications")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[r(i,{to:"/watermeterkit-v2/warranty-and-support.html"},{default:o(()=>[t("Warranty and Support")]),_:1})])]),p,e("ol",null,[e("li",null,[m,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("Detailed installation instructions can be found in the "),r(i,{to:"/watermeterkit-v2/installation.html"},{default:o(()=>[t("Installation Guide")]),_:1}),t(".")])])]),w,e("li",null,[f,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("Refer to the "),r(i,{to:"/watermeterkit-v2/troubleshooting.html"},{default:o(()=>[t("Troubleshooting Guide")]),_:1}),t(" for steps to resolve common issues.
