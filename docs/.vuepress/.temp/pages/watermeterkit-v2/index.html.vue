<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I install the WaterMeterKit?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed installation instructions can be found in the <RouteLink to="/watermeterkit-v2/installation.html">Installation Guide</RouteLink>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I connect the WaterMeterKit to my WiFi network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon starting up the kit, the WaterMeterKit emits a WiFi hotspot named 'watermeterkit' with the password 'watermeterkit'. Connect to this hotspot and follow the on-screen instructions to select and connect to your own WiFi network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What should I do if the WaterMeterKit is not reporting data correctly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the <RouteLink to="/watermeterkit-v2/troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Guide</RouteLink> for steps to resolve common issues. Ensure all cables are securely connected and the sensor is properly positioned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the WaterMeterKit waterproof?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The watersensor is IP52 rated, providing protection against dust and light moisture. However, the main unit is IP20 rated and suitable for indoor use only. Any defects caused by water exposure are not covered under warranty. For more details, refer to the <RouteLink to="/watermeterkit-v2/technical-specifications.html">Technical Specifications</RouteLink> page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How does the WaterMeterKit measure water flow?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The WaterMeterKit works by placing a sensor on the 1-liter indication of your water meter. There is a metal plate inside the meter that completes one full rotation for every liter of water used. The kit measures the position of this metal plate to determine the flow rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the difference between the WaterMeterKit and the WaterFlowKit?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The WaterMeterKit is designed to read the water meter provided by your water utility or a standalone water meter with a 1-liter metal plate indicator. In contrast, the WaterFlowKit is intended to be installed on an individual pipe within your home. This allows you to monitor specific points of water usage, such as individual faucets or lines, and you can install multiple WaterFlowKits throughout your home to monitor different locations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the difference between the WaterMeterKit and the WaterP1MeterKit?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The WaterMeterKit is designed to read the water meter provided by your water utility or a standalone water meter with a 1-liter metal plate indicator. The WaterP1MeterKit, on the other hand, can also be used to measure your water consumption but includes additional features. The WaterP1MeterKit connects to your energy meter via a P1 port to read energy usage data and has an Ethernet port with Power over Ethernet (PoE) support. This means you can use a wired connection instead of WiFi, providing a more stable and reliable network connection. The WaterMeterKit only has WiFi build-in.</li>
