</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the Power Source</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the power adapter is plugged into a working electrical outlet.</li>
<li>If using Power over Ethernet (PoE), ensure your Ethernet cable is connected to a PoE-enabled port on your router or switch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restart the WaterP1MeterKit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unplug the power cable from the WaterP1MeterKit, wait for 10 seconds, and then plug it back in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restart Home Assistant</strong></p>

<h2 id="wifi-connectivity-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wifi-connectivity-issues"><span>WiFi Connectivity Issues</span></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Check WiFi Signal Strength</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the WaterP1MeterKit is within range of your WiFi router. Weak signal strength can cause connectivity issues.</li>
<li>If necessary, move the WaterP1MeterKit closer to the router or use a WiFi extender to improve signal strength.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reconnect to WiFi</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the WaterP1MeterKit is not connecting to your WiFi network, try reconnecting:
<ol>
<li>Power off the WaterP1MeterKit.</li>
<li>Power it back on and connect to the WiFi hotspot named 'waterp1meterkit' with the password 'waterp1meterkit'.</li>
<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to select and connect to your WiFi network.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check WiFi Network Configuration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your WiFi network is set to 2.4 GHz, as the WaterP1MeterKit does not support 5 GHz networks.</li>
<li>Verify that your WiFi network is not using a hidden SSID. If it is, make sure to manually enter the SSID and password during the setup process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify WiFi Firmware</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the WiFi firmware is installed on the WaterP1MeterKit. If there is no Ethernet cable connected and the green LED on the Ethernet port is on, then the Ethernet firmware is installed. If the LED is off, the WiFi firmware is installed. Refer to our <a href="https://smarthomeshop.io/firmware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firmware page</a> for instructions on how to update or switch the firmware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ethernet-poe-connectivity-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ethernet-poe-connectivity-issues"><span>Ethernet / PoE Connectivity Issues</span></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Ethernet Cable Connection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the Ethernet cable is securely connected to both the WaterP1MeterKit and a PoE-enabled port on your router or switch.</li>
<li>Verify that the Ethernet cable is not damaged and is functioning properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify PoE Power Supply</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your router or switch supports PoE and is providing power to the WaterP1MeterKit through the Ethernet cable.</li>
<li>If possible, test the Ethernet cable and PoE port with another device to confirm they are working correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify Ethernet Firmware</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the Ethernet firmware is installed on the WaterP1MeterKit. If there is no Ethernet cable connected and the green LED on the Ethernet port is on, then the Ethernet firmware is installed. If the LED is off, the WiFi firmware is installed. Refer to our <a href="https://smarthomeshop.io/firmware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firmware page</a> for instructions on how to update or switch the firmware.</li>

<h2 id="data-reading-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-reading-issues"><span>Data Reading Issues</span></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Water Meter Data Not Updating</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the water sensor is correctly positioned on the water meter. Adjust the sensor's position slightly if necessary.</li>
<li>Turn on a tap. The WaterP1MeterKit should flash a green light for 1 second after each liter of water used to confirm measurement.</li>
<li>Check for any physical obstructions or dirt that might be blocking the sensor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
